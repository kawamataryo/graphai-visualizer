# Code Style Guidelines

## Code Style Checking

After making any code changes, you MUST run the code style check using:

```bash
npm run check
```

This command uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) to ensure consistent code style across the project. The configuration is defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json).

### Why is this important?

1. Maintains consistent code style across the project
2. Catches potential issues early
3. Ensures all code follows the same formatting rules
4. Makes code reviews easier
5. Prevents style-related merge conflicts

### When to run check?

- After making any code changes
- Before committing changes
- Before creating a pull request
- After resolving merge conflicts

### What does it check?

The check command enforces:
- Consistent quote usage (double quotes)
- Proper indentation
- Function parameter formatting
- Import/export statement formatting
- And other Biome rules

### Example

If you see style issues after running the check, they will look like this:

```
style/useDoubleQuotes  Use double quotes instead of single quotes
style/useSpaces       Use spaces instead of tabs
```

Fix these issues before proceeding with any other changes.
