# Git Workflow Guidelines

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow these rules:

1. Start with a lowercase verb that describes the change:
   - `add` - for new features/files
   - `fix` - for bug fixes
   - `update` - for updates to existing features
   - `bump` - for version updates
   - `use` - for changing usage of something

2. Keep the first line concise and descriptive
3. Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
4. Use lowercase throughout

Examples from the project:
```bash
fix code style and formatting
add .cursor to gitignore
use remote agent info
bump version
```

## Pull Requests

### PR Title
- Should be clear and descriptive
- Start with a verb in present tense
- Use Title Case for words
- Example: "Add Configurable Agent Click Action"

### PR Description Structure

```markdown
## Changes

Brief bullet points of all changes made:
- Change 1
- Change 2

## Details

Detailed explanation of major changes, grouped by feature:

### Feature Name
Detailed description of the feature...

### Another Feature
Another detailed description...

## Testing

Checklist of testing points:
- [ ] Test point 1
- [ ] Test point 2
```

### PR Description Formatting

When creating PRs using the GitHub CLI (`gh`), proper formatting is crucial for readability:

1. Use `$'...'` string format to properly handle line breaks:
```bash
gh pr create --title "Title" --body $'## Changes\n\n- First change\n- Second change'
```

2. Escape special characters:
   - Single quotes: `\'`
   - Double quotes: `\"`
   - Line breaks: `\n`
   - Multiple line breaks: `\n\n`

3. Common patterns:
   - Section breaks: `\n\n## Section\n\n`
   - List items: `\n- Item`
   - Nested content: `\n  Nested content`

Example of well-formatted PR creation:
```bash
gh pr edit 10 --body $'## Changes\n\n- Change one\n- Change two\n\n## Details\n\nDetailed explanation\n\n## Testing\n\n- [ ] Test item'
```

This ensures the PR description appears properly formatted on GitHub with correct line breaks and Markdown rendering.

Example PR: [extension.ts](mdc:src/extension.ts) changes are documented in PR with:
```markdown
## Changes
- Add configuration option for agent click action (docs/source)
- Add remote agent index fetching with local fallback
- Add English documentation and comments
- Fix code style and formatting

## Details
### Configuration Option
This PR adds a new configuration option that allows users to customize...

### Remote Agent Index
The extension now fetches the agent index from the GitHub repository...

## Testing
- [ ] Verify that clicking on agent names opens documentation by default
- [ ] Verify that changing the setting to 'source' makes clicks open source code
...
```

## Code Review Process

1. Before creating PR:
   - Run `npm run check` to ensure code style
   - Review all changes with `git diff`
   - Make sure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed

2. After creating PR:
   - Review the generated PR description
   - Check if all changes are properly documented
   - Verify that testing checklist is complete and relevant
   - Ensure PR description is properly formatted with correct line breaks
